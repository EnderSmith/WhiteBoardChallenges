_Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with three properties: - The highest value - The lowest value - The average of all values_

Problem domain: 
`// I am admittedly unclear on what this means?, similarly, I am unclear about the grading criteria mentioning big O analysis, that said...`

The problem domain is data analysis.

My solution is O(N), because the array could be infinitely long, but my code does not compound that by looping.
