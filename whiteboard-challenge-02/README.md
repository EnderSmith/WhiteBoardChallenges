To access solution with cli:
`> node`
`> const highestTwoValues = require('./solution');`
`> highestTwoValues(/* your array goes here */);`

To access solution.test.js with cli:
`> npm run test`

Problem domain: Data analysis, validation, and unit testing

Big O analysis: `highestTwoValues` loops through an array of indeterminate size twice. I think therefore, that this would be a case of _2O(N)_. 

(Please comment if that's incorrect)
